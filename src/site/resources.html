            <ul>
                <li>
                    API Refactoring: Synapse relations are now established through a separate builder class.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The range positions are now optionally variable. This feature is required for text generation. In this
                    use case the positions are not known in advance and need to be computed during processing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Introduced passive neurons. Passive neurons are only evaluated if the connected output neuron requires it.
                    Passive neurons act basically like callback functions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Optimization of the interpretation search.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lots of bug fixes.
                </li>
            </ul>

			<h3>AIKA Version 0.17 (2018-05-14)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Introduction of synapse relations. Previously the relation between synapses was implicitly modeled
					through word positions (RIDs). Now it is possible to explicitly model relations like: The end position of
					input activation 1 equals to the begin position of input activation 2. Two types of relations are
					currently supported, range relations and instance relations. Range relations compare the input
					activation range of a given synapse with that of the linked synapse. Instance relations also compare
					the input activations of two synapses, but instead of the ranges the dependency relations of these
					activations are compared.
				</li>
				<li>
					Removed the norm term from the interpretation objective function.
				</li>
				<li>
					Introduced an optional distance function to synapses. It allows to model a weakening signal depending
					on the distance of the activation ranges.
				</li>
				<li>
					Example implementation of a context free grammar.
				</li>
				<li>
					Example implementation for co-reference resolution.
				</li>
				<li>
					Work on an syllable identification experiment based on the meta network implementation.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>AIKA Version 0.15 (2018-03-16)</h3>
			<ul>

				</li>
				<li>
					Moved the activation linking and activation selection code to separate classes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ongoing work on the training algorithms.
				</li>
			</ul>


			<h3>AIKA Version 0.14 (2018-02-04)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Caching of partially computed states in the neural network during the interpretation search.
				</li>
				<li>
					Refactoring of the interpretation search. The search is now iterative to prevent stack overflows. The debugging output is much more detailed now.
				</li>
				<li>
					Ongoing work on the training algorithms.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>AIKA Version 0.13 (2018-01-20)</h3>

					suppressed if they are conflicting with other activations.
				</li>
				<li>
					Removed some old experimental training code and provided two APIs for training and pattern discovery.
					The APIs allow to implement heuristics when deciding which synapses should be created or which
					patterns should be selected.
				</li>
				<li>
					Experimental support for text generation.
				</li>
			</ul>
